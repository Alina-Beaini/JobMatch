Job Match is a web application that helps match employers to jobseekers based on needs, majors, years of experience, etc.

## Registration Process
Any user that wishes to register has to specify whether they are employers or jobseekers; this is because the information that we're collecting from each user are different for employers and jobseekers.

For example, for an employer we will need a company name (but the name of the user creating the account is not required), whereas jobseekers have to provide their degrees and majors, as well as how many years of experience they have in their particular fields.

## Login
Once logged in, again, the layout is slightly different for employers and jobseekers

### Employer
An employer should specify what majors (if any) they are looking for to fill in a particular position as well as the minimum years of experience required.

### Job Seeker
A jobseeker, on the other hand, only needs to tell us how many years of experience he has working in this particular position he's looking for. All the jobs that were entered can be eddited (for example, to change the minimum years of experience required or so), and they can also be deleted once they're not needed anymore (for example if an employer already filled in the position, or if a jobseeker already got a job) Once all the jobs are listed, the users can go to "Find matches".

## Finding Matches
When employers click on "Find Matches", they will see lists of all potential candidates (from our database) that qualify to the different job position they're looking for. 

Instead of listing ALL of the jobseekers randomly, they will be divided based on what job position they would be best hired for (these queries will be based on the jobseekers' majors and years of experience). 

Of course, the only jobseekers we're matching with are going to be ones who satisfy all the requirements that the employers are specifying. Similarly, when jobseekers go to "Find Matches", they will see a list of all the employers who have vacancies they are qualified to fill! The only difference here is that, not only are we going to get employers who are looking to fill positions we were seeking, but also employers who have vacancies that we can fill with our qualifications. 

More precisely, suppose that you are a computer science major and you're looking for a job as an assistant (which you will find matches for). Maybe, you didn't know that you can actually land a job as a Head IT! The job of my application is to also inform you that there are companies who are looking for Head ITs and you are qualified for these jobs! These will be in a table under "Based on your major".

Once matches are found, the users can always click on "See more" to get more information about their matches, specifically their contact information so that they can contact them.

Finally, the users' profiles can be eddited at any time: for example if the phone numbers/emails change and or if a jobseeker acquired more years of experience, and so on...
